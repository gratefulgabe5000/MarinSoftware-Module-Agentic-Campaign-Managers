## Key Findings

### Working Features ✅
- CSV upload and parsing (valid files)
- Campaign generation (single and multiple products)
- Campaign preview display
- Character limit validation (prevention via maxLength)
- CSV export (valid campaigns)
- Progress indicators during generation
- Drag-and-drop file upload

### Critical Issues ❌
- **Data Integrity**: BUG-014 - Keyword deletion deletes wrong item (High Priority)
- **Export Functionality**: BUG-017 - Export validation fails with empty errors array (High Priority)
- **Error Feedback**: BUG-018 - CSV upload errors not displayed in UI (High Priority)
- **Performance Export**: BUG-011 - Performance Dashboard Export CSV fails (High Priority)

### Recently Fixed ✅
- **Drag-and-Drop**: BUG-001 - Drop zone no longer resizes during drag operation
- **CSV Upload**: BUG-002 - Products now merge instead of overwriting (prevents data loss)
- **UI Sticky Elements**: BUG-003, BUG-004, BUG-009 - Edit/delete buttons and navigation now sticky
- **Preview Layout**: BUG-006 - Campaign preview pages now match dashboard layout with PREVIEW badge

### Areas for Improvement ⚠️
- Error messages need better visibility and display
- Inline editing behavior needs refinement (explicit save/cancel buttons)
- Sticky positioning needed for several UI elements (filter bars, headers, tab navigation)
- Display updates need to reflect store changes immediately
- Validation error navigation needs implementation

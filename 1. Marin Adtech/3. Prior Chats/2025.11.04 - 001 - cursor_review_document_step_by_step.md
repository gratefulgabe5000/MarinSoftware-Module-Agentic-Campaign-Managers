Reviewing the document and starting with Task 1.1.1: Database Provisioning.


## Document Review Summary

**Project:** 20K Leads Sprint - LinkedIn Performance Marketers Lead Generation  
**Role:** Data Engineer / Database Administrator  
**Target:** 20,000 non-duplicate leads by midday tomorrow

**Document Structure:**
- 5 phases with multiple subphases and tasks
- Phase 1: Database & Infrastructure Setup (MongoDB, Redis, Connection Pooling)
- Phase 2: Data Pipeline Development & Integration
- Phase 3: Integration Testing & Performance Validation
- Phase 4: Sprint Execution (Monitoring)
- Phase 5: Database Analysis & Final Reporting

---

## Starting Task 1.1.1: Database Provisioning

This task includes:
1. Provision MongoDB Atlas database (M30+ cluster: 4+ vCPU, 8GB+ RAM, 50GB+ storage)
2. Configure minimum specifications
3. Configure connection pooling (50+ connections)
4. Set up backup system
5. Configure security settings

### Prerequisites
- MongoDB Atlas account access
- Network access and firewall configuration
- N8N server IP address (for network whitelist)

### Steps to complete

1. Create/access MongoDB Atlas account
   - Go to: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
   - Sign up or log in

2. Create cluster
   - Tier: M30 or higher (recommended for 4+ vCPU, 8GB+ RAM)
   - Region: closest to your N8N server
   - Storage: 10GB+ (auto-scaling enabled)
   - Cluster name: `lead-generation-cluster` or `performance-marketers-cluster`

3. Create database user
   - Username: `admin` or `n8n_user`
   - Strong password (store securely)
   - Permissions: "Atlas admin" or "Read and write to any database"

4. Configure network access
   - Add N8N server IP address OR
   - For development: `0.0.0.0/0` (not recommended for production)

5. Get connection string
   - Format: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/`
   - Store securely

Should I continue with the next steps (configure connection pooling, backup system, and security settings), or do you want to complete the MongoDB Atlas provisioning first and provide the connection details?

Please confirm:
- Do you have a MongoDB Atlas account?
- Do you have the N8N server IP address?
- What cluster tier would you like to use (M30 recommended)?

Once you confirm, I'll proceed with documenting the configuration and moving to the next steps.

n we will set them up

Understood—you'll set up MongoDB Atlas and Redis. I'll wait for your confirmation before proceeding.

## Next steps after setup

Once MongoDB Atlas is provisioned, share:
1. MongoDB connection string (without password)
2. Database name (e.g., `lead_generation` or `performance_marketers`)
3. Cluster tier used (M30, M40, etc.)
4. N8N server IP address (for network whitelist)

Once you confirm MongoDB is ready, I'll:
- Document the configuration
- Create the database schema
- Set up indexes
- Configure connection pooling
- Set up backup verification
- Proceed to the next task

For Redis:
- Host and port
- Authentication (if required)
- Instance type/size

Status: Waiting for MongoDB Atlas setup completion.

Please confirm when MongoDB Atlas is ready, and I'll proceed with Task 1.1.2: Database Schema Creation.

**User**

OK, we have redirected, as the BrightData /scraping of LinkedIn approach is running into technical blocks.  We are focusing now on apollo.io as a more reliable avenue to 20k leads today.  any advice?

---

**Cursor**


Pivoting from BrightData/LinkedIn scraping to Apollo.io. Reviewing the PRD and current setup to provide guidance:


Apollo.io is already in the PRD as a secondary source. Reviewing the database schema and Apollo.io considerations:


Advice for the Apollo.io pivot:

1. Database schema compatibility
- Current schema supports Apollo.io fields. Reviewing the schema to confirm:


Database schema is compatible with Apollo.io. Summary and recommendations:

## Apollo.io pivot: database engineer recommendations

### 1. Schema compatibility — no changes needed
- Current schema supports Apollo.io fields
- `additional_data` object can store Apollo-specific fields
- `data_source` field can be set to "Apollo.io"

### 2. Data transformation adjustments
Apollo.io API typically returns:
- `first_name`, `last_name` (vs. `full_name`) — combine into `full_name`
- `linkedin_url` — may be in different format — normalize
- `email` — often included (higher email rate expected)
- `company` object — may need flattening to `company_name`, `company_website`, etc.
- `organization` object — may contain company details

Action: Coordinate with Technical Lead to map Apollo.io API response to your schema.

### 3. Rate limits and throughput
- Apollo.io: ~10 requests/second (per PRD)
- For 20K leads: If 25 results per page, you need ~800 pages = ~80 seconds at 10 req/sec
- Consider: Scale up Apollo.io workflows if needed (currently 2 workflows planned)

### 4. Deduplication strategy
- Apollo.io data is typically cleaner, but still deduplicate against:
  - Other Apollo.io workflows
  - Other data sources (if used)
- Redis keys should work: `lead:linkedin:{linkedin_url}` and `lead:email:{email}`

### 5. Data quality expectations
- Apollo.io data is typically higher quality
- Expected: >75% quality score (likely higher)
- Email availability: >25% (likely higher with Apollo.io)
- Action: Update quality scoring thresholds if needed

### 6. Database optimization priorities

Immediate actions:
1. Ensure indexes are created (especially `linkedin_url` unique index)
2. Optimize for batch inserts (Apollo.io can return bulk data)
3. Test duplicate checking performance with Apollo.io data format

### 7. Updated volume projections
- Original: Apollo.io 25-35% (5,000-7,000 leads)
- New focus: Primary source → potentially 20K+ leads from Apollo.io
- Scaling: May need more Apollo.io workflows/API calls

### 8. Cost considerations
- Apollo.io: $200-500 (per PRD) for 5K-7K leads
- If scaling to 20K leads: Budget may increase
- Coordinate with Project Manager on subscription tier

## Recommended next steps

1. Database setup (continuing as planned)
   - MongoDB Atlas provisioning
   - Schema creation (no changes needed)
   - Index setup
   - Redis cache setup

2. Coordinate with Technical Lead
   - Apollo.io API response format
   - Data transformation mapping
   - Rate limit handling in N8N

3. Test with sample Apollo.io data
   - Import sample records
   - Verify schema compatibility
   - Test deduplication
   - Validate data quality scoring

## Questions for the team

1. Apollo.io subscription tier: Which tier supports 20K leads?
2. API rate limits: What are the exact limits for your tier?
3. Data format: Can you share a sample Apollo.io API response?
4. Workflow scaling: How many Apollo.io workflows should we plan for?

Proceeding with database setup (Task 1.1.1) is safe — the schema already supports Apollo.io. We can adjust the data transformation layer once we see the actual API responses.

Should I continue with Task 1.1.1: Database Provisioning, or wait for Apollo.io API details first?

   - CRM integration requirements
   - Monitoring and reporting requirements
4. **Non-Functional Requirements** (NFR-001 through NFR-013) - Performance, reliability, scalability, security, and cost requirements
5. **Target Profile Definition** - Job titles, geographic focus, company types
6. **Data Schema Requirements** - Required fields, enrichment fields, metadata fields
7. **Success Criteria** - Volume, quality, operational, and cost success criteria
8. **Constraints & Assumptions** - Time, budget, dependencies
9. **Risk Assessment** - Technical, business, and data source risks
10. **Acceptance Criteria** - Product acceptance and Go/No-Go criteria

The PRD is focused on **what** needs to be built and **why**, rather than **how** it's implemented. It aligns with the Apollo.io pivot and maintains compatibility with additional data sources.

Should I:
1. Create a separate PDR (Project Design Review) document with the technical implementation details?
2. Make any adjustments to the PRD?
3. Continue with the database setup tasks?
